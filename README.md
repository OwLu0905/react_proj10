# Project: react 
## use the skill
* Functional component
* useState hook
* props
* controlled component inputs

## Content 
* use `useState()` to change the color style of background color
* the color will be changed with the input value, and will show the type value immediately in the block above the input line.
* If the color style was invalid, the warnning text will tell you in the `<footer>` block.

## Something to be improved
* easily control the css style 
* be more familiar with `OnChange()`, `OnClick()` ...etc.
